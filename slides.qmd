## Roadmap {background-color="#E5E4E2"}

Why are we doing this? *Introduction*

Can you see how people move in the city? *R package `quadkey`* 

Can COVID-19 be related with movement in the city? - *GeoCovid app*

## COVID-19
#### Human behavioral component starts being recognized


- Map how **human mobility changes in space** depending on
the decisions that were made and how that correlated with the cases.


- Project with researchers from Argentina -> Stricter quarantine

## COVID-19
#### Human behavioral component starts being recognized

**Social, Preventive, and Obligatory isolation established by the Argentine government**

- Phase 1: Strict isolation. 
- Phase 2: Managed isolation. 
- Phase 3: Isolation by geographic segmentation. 
- Phase 4: Isolation with progressive reopening. 
- Phase 5: Last phase search to re-establish new normality.

## Objectives
#### Spatial dynamics of data


* Fundamental tool to map risk and monitor how decision making
affects the distribution of cases in a community or city.

* Quick overview to monitor decisions   


## Step 1
#### From QuadKeys to raster images

**QuadKeys** represent a location on a map by encoding its hierarchical 
spatial position as a sequence of characters.

üîéüìÑ

## Step 1
#### From QuadKeys to raster images

The tiles can have different sizes,
producing maps with more or less level of detail.

## Step 1
#### From QuadKeys to raster images

The conversion from QuadKey to raster involve several steps

## Why to create an R package
#### When is a good idea to create a software package as part of a research?
- Makes easier to reuse the functions.
- Better code quality (i.e. tests, documentation)
- Ensures computational reproducibility.

## Example 

- We were not going to see the consequences of decisions immediately.
- Non-permitted behaviors would be possible to detect. 

## Conclusion

We managed to generate the raster to visualize citizen mobility on a map

## GeoCovidAR

Integrate city mobility information with daily reported covid cases

## Tab 1

General exploration

## Tab 2

Compare departments

You can download a report

## Tab 3

Generalidades

## Conclusions

- GeoCovidAR App integrates COVID-19 and Facebook Mobility Data

## Where is the project data?
#### Website: GeoCovid Buenos Aires

3 datasets 

COVID-19
rasters

## Overview del proyect

## Conclusion

- Monitoring system
- Integration ecological components
(hosts there are distribution and contacts) with the complexity of the
human behavior. 
This determines the spatial distribution of cases and is essential
to understand the dynamics of transmission.
- Flexible tool daptable to future scenarios
